## Installation

### From Community plugins (recommended)

1. Open Obsidian Settings > Community plugins > Browse.
2. Search for "reMarkable Sync", install it, and enable it.
3. Open the plugin settings and authenticate with your reMarkable account.

### Manual install

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/TimDommett/Remarkable-Sync---Obsidian-Plugin/releases/latest).
2. Place them in `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/remarkable-sync/`.
3. Enable "reMarkable Sync" under Settings > Community plugins, then authenticate in the plugin settings.

**Note:** This is a desktop-only plugin (requires Obsidian desktop app).

## Privacy & data

- This plugin connects to the **reMarkable Cloud API** (`*.remarkable.com`) to download your documents. No data is sent to any other service.
- Authentication tokens are stored locally on your machine at `~/.remarkable-sync/token.json`, outside the Obsidian vault.
- No telemetry or analytics are collected.

## Authentication

1. Go to https://my.remarkable.com/device/desktop/connect to get a one-time code
2. Enter the code in the plugin settings (Obsidian Settings > reMarkable Sync)
3. Auth tokens are stored locally at `~/.remarkable-sync/token.json`

## Usage

- Click the tablet icon in the Obsidian ribbon to sync
- Or use the command palette: **reMarkable Sync: Sync now**
- Documents are saved as PDFs in your configured vault subfolder (or as Markdown, see **Output format**)
- Enable auto-sync in settings for hands-free operation

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Sync folder | `reMarkable/` | Subfolder in your vault for synced documents |
| Auto-sync | Off | Sync automatically on a timer |
| Sync interval | 5 min | How often to auto-sync |
| Output format | PDF | PDF, Markdown, or both. Markdown contains only typed text (handwriting and drawings are skipped), is overwritten on each sync of that document, and is not written for documents without typed text |

## Development

### Project structure

```
src/                          # TypeScript source code
  cloud-client.ts             # reMarkable Cloud API (sync15/v3 protocol)
  rm-parser.ts                # v6 binary .rm format parser
  pdf-renderer.ts             # PDF generation via pdf-lib
  document-converter.ts       # reMarkable archive → PDF pipeline (pdf-lib)
  markdown-converter.ts       # Typed text → Markdown export
  sync-manager.ts             # Sync orchestration with incremental state tracking
  main.ts                     # Obsidian plugin entry point
  settings.ts                 # Settings tab UI
  constants.ts                # Shared constants

reference_sheets/             # Ground truth: PDFs exported from reMarkable + raw .rm files
compare-reference-sheets.ts   # Metadata comparison tool
compare-pixels.mjs            # Pixel-to-pixel rasterized comparison (MuPDF WASM)
compare-pdfs.ts               # PDF comparison utility
re-render.ts                  # Re-renders .rm files to PDFs for comparison
verify-coords.mjs             # Coordinate mapping verification

run-sync.ts                   # Standalone CLI sync (no Obsidian dependency)
release/remarkable-sync/      # Build output (git-ignored, regenerated by `npm run build`)
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimDommett/Remarkable-Sync---Obsidian-Plugin.git
cd Remarkable-Sync---Obsidian-Plugin
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build    # Type-check + production build
npm run dev      # Watch mode (rebuilds on changes)
```

The build writes the plugin assets to `release/remarkable-sync/` (`main.js`,
`manifest.json`, `styles.css`). That folder is git-ignored and regenerated on
every build.

### Run a development build in Obsidian

Because the build folder is named after the plugin id, the simplest workflow is
to symlink it straight into a test vault's plugins directory:

```bash
npm run build
ln -s "$(pwd)/release/remarkable-sync" "<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/remarkable-sync"
```

On Windows, use `mklink /D` from an elevated prompt, or copy the folder instead
of symlinking. Then enable **reMarkable Sync** under Settings > Community
plugins. Run `npm run dev` while developing and reload Obsidian (`Ctrl/Cmd + R`)
to pick up each rebuild.

### Test the sync engine without Obsidian

The core modules have no Obsidian dependency, so you can exercise them from the
command line:

```bash
npm run test:unit      # Unit tests (cloud client)
npx tsx run-sync.ts    # Full sync of all documents into ./reMarkable
```

Register once via the plugin (or `run-sync.ts`) before syncing — get a one-time
auth code from https://my.remarkable.com/device/desktop/connect.

### Reference sheets

The `reference_sheets/` directory contains PDFs exported directly from reMarkable alongside their raw `.rm` source files. These are the ground truth for validating rendering accuracy.

Each subdirectory covers a specific pen tool or feature with every color and thickness:
- **Pen tools:** Ballpoint, Calligraphy Pen, Fineliner, Highlighter, Marker, Mechanical Pencil, Paintbrush, Pencil, Shader
- **Features:** Text, Checklist, Layers, Pages
- **Templates:** Blank, Grid medium, Lined

Use the comparison tools to validate rendering:

```bash
npx tsx compare-reference-sheets.ts   # Compare metadata (colors, widths, dimensions)
node compare-pixels.mjs               # Pixel comparison against reference PDFs
npx tsx re-render.ts                   # Re-render .rm files and compare output
```

### Architecture notes

- **`FileOps` interface** abstracts file I/O so the same core code works in both Node.js (CLI) and Obsidian (plugin)
- **reMarkable v6 .rm format** is parsed from binary with zero dependencies — see `rm-parser.ts`
- **Coordinate mapping** converts .rm canvas coordinates (1404x1872, centered X) to PDF points (514pt wide)
- **CRDT text** is decoded with topological sorting for correct character ordering
- Runtime dependency: `pdf-lib` (PDF creation), bundled into the plugin; reMarkable archives are read directly without a ZIP library

## Contributing

### Bug reports

Please open an issue with:
- A description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Your Obsidian version and OS
- **The sync log** — for any sync-related problem, attach the relevant section
  of `<sync folder>/_reMarkable Sync Log.md` (open it via the **Open log** button
  in settings or the **reMarkable Sync: Open sync log** command). The log contains
  the specific per-document error messages needed to diagnose failures. If the log
  is missing, enable **Write sync log** in settings and reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant error messages from the developer console (Ctrl+Shift+I)
